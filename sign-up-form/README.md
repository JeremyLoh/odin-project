# Requirements
1) Design is in design/sign-up-form.png
2) Get a large background image from unsplash.com
3) Pick external font for the "logo" section. e.g. Norse Bold

# Tips
1) How to start is up to you, but it is wise to begin by scaffolding out the structure of the page, and then tackle the various sections one by one
2) Area behind the "ODIN" logo is a div that has a dark, but semi-transparent background color. This enhances the readability of the text against the busy background image
3) Color we have chosen for the "Create Account" button is similar to tones found in the background image. Specifically it is #596D48
4) The inputs, by default have a very light border (#E5E5EB), but we have included 2 variations. For starters, the password inputs should have a red border if they contain an invalid password. This can be handled with the :invalid pseudo-class you've learned in the previous lesson
5) The other variation is the selected input, which should have a blue border and subtle box-shadow. This can be done with the :focus pseudo-class you've learned about in an earlier lesson
6) Do not worry about making your project look nice on mobile, but DO resize your browser a little bit to make sure it is not completely broken at different desktop resolutions
7) Checking that the password field match each other requires javascript. Try to implement this if you feel confident, otherwise just validate each field separately
